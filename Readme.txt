Fourier Spectrum of Signals

The discrete Fourier transformation

To do:

1)Compute the Fourier transform of simple signals.
 -The sample is periodic on the interval.(The frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency)
 -The sample is non periodic on the interval.
 -Aliasing. (samples that include frequencies above the critical value)
2)Show that for real signals:
 -F_N-k=F*(k)
 -FN & FN⁻¹ are inverse
3)Fourier analysis of the sound of the wood-box resonator and the fork (book's web-page).
 -Plot the power spectral density.
 -Identify eigenmodes from most prominent peaks.
4)Fourier analysis ode the concluding chord of the Toccata and Fugue for an organ in f-minor (Optional or important)
 -What happens when the sample frequency is reduced? CD vs mp3
